# Ray Trace A Triangle

This repo is based on the raytracing tutorials by nvidia. You can find them here: [Part 1](https://developer.nvidia.com/rtx/raytracing/dxr/dx12-raytracing-tutorial-part-1) & [Part 2](https://developer.nvidia.com/rtx/raytracing/dxr/dx12-raytracing-tutorial-part-2)

Unfortunately the tutorial seems to be broken (missing code due to parsing issues) but I tried my best to recreate their markdown.

You can find the ressurected mark down here: [Tutorial Part 2](02Tutorial.md)
